# A simple Twitter bot

## Description

This project demonstrates how to use the Twitter api to programatically interact with Twitter! In my example, the Twitter bot posts random Giphy Gifs (provided by the Giphy api) with randomly selected famous quotes along side them as the caption. Tweets are created and posted every four hours.

This code is deployed through Heroku as a 'worker' server.
